# React-Native

In this repo contains all the important topics about React-Native.
React Native is a JavaScript framework for writing real, natively rendering mobile applications for iOS and Android. It’s based on React, Facebook’s JavaScript library for building user interfaces, but instead of targeting the browser, it targets mobile platforms. In other words: web developers can now write mobile applications that look and feel truly “native,” all from the comfort of a JavaScript library that we already know and love. Plus, because most of the code you write can be shared between platforms, React Native makes it easy to simultaneously develop for both Android and iOS.   

Topics Covered:

* Graphical User Interface
* Interaction with Native Code
* Connectivity with Native Code
* Data Storage and Sensors
* External Libraries
